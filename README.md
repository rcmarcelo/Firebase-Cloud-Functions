# Firebase Cloud Functions
Hey! First of all, you should take a look at my Firebase Web Codelab [repo](https://github.com/rcmarcelo/Firebase-Web-Codelab).

From another Google Codelab tutorial, this time it teaches  how to use the Firebase SDK for Google Cloud Functions by improving FriendlyChat.

You can learn how to do it by following the step-by-step Google Codelab [here](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-cloud-functions).

If you want to see it running, my version is right [here](https://friendlychat-1e59c.firebaseapp.com/)!
